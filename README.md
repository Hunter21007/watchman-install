# watchman-install

bash script to install [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) on linux

I have created this because i needed to do this to use vscode extension
[GraphQL for VsCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kumar-harsh.graphql-for-vscode)

And there was no rpm for fc26.

the original instructions are got from [davidmason](https://gist.github.com/davidmason/5b9c43202ad4c4ff562badbf2a25ae68)

## Thanks
